Sitting in a corner all alone
Staring from the bottom of his soul
Watching the night come in from the window, window

It'll all collapse tonight
The full moon is here again
In sickness and in health
Understanding, so demanding
It has no name-, there's one for every season
Makes him insane to know

Running away from it all
'I'll be safe in the cornfields,' he thinks
Hunted by his own
Again he feels the moon rising on the sky

Find a barn which to sleep in, but can he hide anymore?
Someone's at the door
Understanding, too demanding
Can this be wrong?
It's love that is not ending
Makes him insane to know

She should not lock the open door
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore

Sees the change in him but can't
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
See what became out of her man
Full moon!

Swimming across the bay
The night is gray, so calm today
She doesn't wanna wait
We've gotta make the love complete tonight

In the mist of the morning he cannot fight anymore
Hundred moons or more he's been howling!
Knock on the door and scream that is soon ending
Mess on the floor again

She should not lock the open door
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore

Sees the change in him but can't
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
See what became out of her man

She should not lock the open door
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore

Sees the change in him but can't
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
See what became out of her darling man

She should not lock the open door
(Run away! Run away! Run away!)
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore
